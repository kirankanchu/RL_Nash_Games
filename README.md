# Reinforcement Learning Policy Iterations for Nash Differential Games

This repository contains the MATLAB code and associated documentation for the project "Reinforcement Learning Policy Iterations for Nash Differential Games".

## Overview

This project integrates reinforcement learning with Nash differential games, applying policy iteration algorithms to identify optimal strategies within complex, dynamic environments. The approach leverages Lyapunov iterations for solving Coupled Algebraic Riccati equations, offering a computational framework for achieving stabilizing solutions in multi-agent scenarios. The MATLAB implementation explores stabilizability and detectability conditions, guiding towards a feasible and stable Nash equilibrium.
